# Use PPT to manage the read papers  
Research often involves the reading and comprehension of numerous academic papers. However, the value of this process diminishes if we're unable to efficiently retrieve the relevant paper when required. I have explored various strategies to manage these read papers and have discovered that using PowerPoint presentations (PPT) offers several advantages:

* Enhances Intellectual Stimulation: The utilization of PPT invigorates my enthusiasm and creativity, fostering a conducive environment for continuous thinking and idea generation.

* Facilitates Swift Paper Retrieval: The ability to search for specific papers is significantly improved within slides, as compared to sifting through titles or keywords in a text-based format.

* Promotes Quick Recall of Key Concepts: Visual aids, such as diagrams or figures within slides, greatly assist in the swift recollection of the main points or findings of a paper.

* Ample Space for Annotations and Hyperlinks: PPT provides sufficient room to include personal notes and external references freely, thereby enhancing the overall understanding and connectivity of the research.

* Improves User Interaction and Paper Organization: PPT delivers a superior user experience and offers an efficient way to categorize and re-cluster papers, making the entire process more engaging and systematic.
